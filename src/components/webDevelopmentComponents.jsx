          Many people wonder â€” what is the difference between a website and an
          application? At first glance, these two concepts are the same, but the
          differences lie in the internal work with them and the creation of the
          project itself.

          This is one or more web pages that show the user informational
          content: articles, videos, pictures, music. As a rule, this data is
          static and the user cannot interact with it, that is, change anything
          on the page. Usually, a site is used to demonstrate products, talk
          about a brand, its history and achievements, publish useful cases and
          articles. Often, authentication is not required here, which means that
          all information is available to every user.

          the content and carry out various manipulations, within acceptable
          limits: add information, communicate with other users, order goods,
          pay for purchases, add or remove products from the basket. Therefore,
          the important point here is to register yourself as a user, and this
          is much more common than with websites.

      <p className={text} style={{ textAlign: "justify" }}>
        Now that we have figured out what a web application is, how it works and
        how it differs from a website, let&apos;s look at their types from a
        technical classification point of view:

            SPA (Single Page Application)
          </span>{" "}
          is a single-page interactive application that does not require
          reloading the main page during its operation. Unlike traditional web
          applications, they work faster, since all the application logic is
          implemented in the browser, not on the server.
        </p>
        <p className="text-2xl font-medium px-10">Positive:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>

              <span className="text-2xl underline pr-2">
                User-friendly interface.
              </span>
              It is easier for the user to navigate on one page, when there is
              only one option for movement - down. No additional links will
              distract his attention and will not allow him to get confused
              inside the program.
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p className={text} style={{ textAlign: "justify" }}>
              <span className="text-2xl underline pr-2">High speed.</span>
              During operation, the application does not update the entire page,
              but only loads the content the user needs. Therefore, it works
              much faster than multi-page sites - a request to the server is
              made once, after which the information on the page is simply
              supplemented.
            </p>

              <span className="text-2xl underline pr-2">Data caching.</span>
              The cache works in the same way - it is enough to contact the
              server once and it will save all the user&apos;s data. Now the client
              will be able to work in the application even in offline mode.

                Insufficient SEO optimization.
              </span>
              Single-page applications have only one URL that does not change
              during operation, unlike multi-page applications. Therefore, the
              developer can bind only one search query to it. Such sites are
              difficult to optimize for search engines due to the fact that the
              search bot simply will not find additionally loaded information.
            </p>

          <li>
            <p className={text} style={{ textAlign: "justify" }}>
              <span className="text-2xl underline pr-2">Poor security.</span>
              Single-page applications are more susceptible to attack by hackers
              who steal user data using cross-site scripts. They inject them
              from the client side and can easily obtain confidential
              information. MPA and PWA, which we will consider below, have much
              better security settings.

        is a multi-page web application. It allows the user to switch between
        individual pages when making a request. Such resources, as a rule, have
        a more complex interface and a large number of additional links. With
        each new request, for example, when paying for a product, the user will
        open a new page.

            <span className="text-2xl underline pr-2">Excellent SEO.</span>
            Unlike SPA, each page of MPA has its own URL, which makes it
            possible to perfectly control user SEO requests - for each of them,
            the developer can add a unique key and meta tags.

              Unlimited scalability.
            </span>
            MPA does not limit you in the number of pages you can create and the
            information you need to place on it. Unlike SPA, you can use many
            functions on one page. Therefore, if your goal is to provide more
            opportunities for the client, choose MPA.

            <span className="text-2xl underline pr-2">Low speed.</span>
            With each interaction with the application, the server reloads and
            updates all resources - HTML, CSS, scripts and all page data.
            Therefore, the response time to a request increases, which can
            negatively affect the performance of the application.

              More complex development.
            </span>
            When creating such an application, a full-fledged development of the
            server and front-end parts of the program and the use of frameworks
            for the external and internal interface is required. All this takes
            much more time, compared to creating an SPA.

            The application can be used directly through the browser, without
            downloading it from the app store. This means that during

            adjust the program to the standard.
